# Digital Image Processing Final Exercises

This repository contains my solutions for the final exercises in the CS14 Digital Image Processing course. The exercises involve various video processing techniques using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.

## Table of Contents
* [Exercise 1: Temporal Grayscale Conversion & Contrast Adjustment](#exercise-1)
* [Exercise 2: Applying a Moving Filter](#exercise-2)
* [Exercise 3: Geometric Transformation - Gradual Rotation](#exercise-3)
* [Exercise 4: Simulating a Simple "Night Vision" Effect](#exercise-4)
* [Exercise 5: Creating a Static Vignette Effect](#exercise-5)

## Setup Instructions
1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x is required.
2.  **Install Libraries:**
    * Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install opencv-python
        pip install numpy
        ```
3.  **Directory Structure:**
    * The repository is organized as follows:
        * `Main Project Folder` (e.g., `DIP_Video_Exercises/`)
            * `YourFullName-FinalExer1/` (e.g., `Juan_Dela_Cruz-FinalExer1/`)
                * `YourFullName_Exer1.py` (e.g., `JuanDelaCruz_Exer1.py`)
                * `output_video.mp4` (Output video generated by the script)
                * `input_video.mp4` (Input video used by the script)
            * `YourFullName-FinalExer2/`
            * `...`

## Exercise 1: Temporal Grayscale Conversion & Contrast Adjustment <a name="exercise-1"></a>
* **Description:** This script converts a color video to grayscale and gradually adjusts the contrast over time.
* **Usage:**
    1.  Ensure you have an input video file named `input_video.mp4` in the `YourFullName-FinalExer1/` folder.
    2.  Run the script:
        ```bash
        python YourFullName_Exer1.py
        ```
    3.  The output video will be saved as `output_video.mp4` in the same folder.

## Exercise 2: Applying a Moving Filter <a name="exercise-2"></a>
* **Description:** This script applies a moving blur effect to a video.
* **Usage:**
    1.  Ensure you have an input video file named `input_video.mp4` in the `YourFullName-FinalExer2/` folder.
    2.  Run the script:
        ```bash
        python YourFullName_Exer2.py
        ```
    3.  The output video will be saved as `output_video.mp4` in the same folder.

## Exercise 3: Geometric Transformation - Gradual Rotation <a name="exercise-3"></a>
* **Description:** This script rotates a video gradually around its center.
* **Usage:**
    1.  Ensure you have an input video file named `input_video.mp4` in the `YourFullName-FinalExer3/` folder.
    2.  Run the script:
        ```bash
        python YourFullName_Exer3.py
        ```
    3.  The output video will be saved as `output_video.mp4` in the same folder.

## Exercise 4: Simulating a Simple "Night Vision" Effect <a name="exercise-4"></a>
* **Description:** This script simulates a night vision effect on a video.
* **Usage:**
    1.  Ensure you have an input video file named `input_video.mp4` in the `YourFullName-FinalExer4/` folder.
    2.  Run the script:
        ```bash
        python YourFullName_Exer4.py
        ```
    3.  The output video will be saved as `output_video.mp4` in the same folder.

## Exercise 5: Creating a Static Vignette Effect <a name="exercise-5"></a>
* **Description:** This script applies a static vignette effect to a video.
* **Usage:**
    1.  Ensure you have an input video file named `input_video.mp4` in the `YourFullName-FinalExer5/` folder.
    2.  Run the script:
        ```bash
        python YourFullName_Exer5.py
        ```
    3.  The output video will be saved as `output_video.mp4` in the same folder.

## Important Notes
* **Input Video Files:** Make sure to replace the placeholder "input_video.mp4" with the actual name of your input video file for each exercise.
* **Output Filenames:** The output video filenames are currently set within the scripts. You can modify them as needed.
* **Large Files:** The output video files might be large. Consider using Git LFS if you intend to store them in the repository or provide alternative means to access them (e.g., cloud storage links).
